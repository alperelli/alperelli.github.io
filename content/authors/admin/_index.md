My research interests include computational imaging, and machine learning, in particular for polyenergetic 3D/4D X-ray CT reconstruction and my specialism and passionate interests span to randomized linear algebra, stochastic iterative algorithms, iterative sketching, probabilistic graphical models and variational inference.

I am dealing with all aspects of the image reconstruction, from the theoretical mathematical modelling, through the algorithm development, to the handling and processing of experimental CT data together with physical modeling.
